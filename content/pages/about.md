## Ham Radio
I originally received my technician no-code license in 1999 as KD5IYZ. At that time I was able to pass my General and Amateur Advanced written exams, and failed to pass my morse code exam. I learned as an adult that I had some fairly significant hearing loss, especially in higher frequencies and the exam tapes I had caused massive ringing in my ears ðŸ˜”. In 2020 I had spare time on my hands and upgraded to General and then amateur Extra. Since there was no code requirement anymore it was much simpler. 

At home I have an Icom 9700 for VHF/UHF, and Icom 7610 for HF. I love to do Parks on the air! I normally run a Yaesu 857d with a wolf river coil. In fact so far I've only activated on 20M so haven't even used the coil ðŸ˜›.
