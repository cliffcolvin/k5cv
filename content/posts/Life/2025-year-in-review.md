2026 is officially here. While I didn't spend as much time writing last year as I'd hoped, 2025 was defined by massive accomplishments, a few hard-hitting losses, and a major change of scenery.

The biggest shift was our move to Liberty Hill, a suburb northwest of Austin. We found an incredible home on an acre of land outside of town and have been loving the space. The move came with the challenge of being further from family; my 15-year-old daughter, Jaelynn, is now eight hours away. We're adapting, though, and I expect we'll have racked up some serious airline miles by the time she graduates.

## 2025 Highlights & Hurdles

**Physical Transformation:** I lost roughly 94 lbs (dropping 20% body fat) and went down six pant sizes and four shirt sizes.

**Career Growth:** I made significant strides at work, successfully keeping my entire Kubecost team intact following our acquisition by IBM.

**Financial Realities:** I'd love to say I hit my savings goals, but the truth is I'm "broke" in the best way possible! Between buying Jaelynn her first car, purchasing our new home, and picking up a Tesla for the commute, it's been a year of big investments.

**Mental Health:** I've made significant investments in my consciousness and learning to live in my "zone of genius."

**Family & Loss:** It's been a tough year on the home front. My mom's Alzheimer's has progressed to the point where she rarely remembers our conversations from the day before. We also lost our dog, Rascal, to lymphoma—it happened so fast it left us in shock.

**New Beginnings:** We adopted Kahlua on December 29th. Much like Rascal, she's a total handful (read: "asshole"), but I love her. She'll be a great addition once she and Jasper learn to coexist.

**Movement:** I walked 696.32 miles. While it wasn't my original goal, it's a massive improvement over any other year of my life. Building the daily habit of dedicated walking has been a game-changer.

We didn't travel extensively, but Taryn joined me for a work trip to Miami Beach, and we took Jaelynn to Pigeon Forge for spring break. Most of our miles were spent driving back to West Texas to visit Jaelynn and wrap up the sale of our old house.

I'm stoked to see what 2026 brings. I'm still refining my goals for the year; I know many people have it all figured out by January 1st, but I've been so focused on executing big projects through December that I haven't quite finished the "pomp and circumstance" of the New Year's list.

For some cute pics!
