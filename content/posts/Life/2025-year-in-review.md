2026 is upon us, and while I haven't spent a lot of time writing, I have accomplished a lot in 2025, and some losses/hard-times too. The big shift was moving to Liberty Hill a suburb north west of Austin, TX. We got an awesome home on 1 acre outside of town, and have loved being here so far! Obviously that is a huge shift as we moved away from our family, and Jaelynn my 15 year-old daughter is about 8 hours away from me. We're adapting though, and will probably have some serious airline miles by the time she graduates.

- Lost ~94 lbs, around 20% body fat, went down 6 pant sizes and 4 shirt sizes.
- Made massive growth and progress at work. Kept my entire Kubecost team in tact after acquisition by IBM.
- I'd like to say I met my financial goals for 2025, but truly I am now broke! I bought my daughter Jaelynn a car after she got her license, bought a new house near Austin, in the middle of selling my pickup and fifth-wheel travel trailer but bought a Tesla for myself to commute!
- Huge personal wins in mental health. I've made significant investments in my consciousness and living in my zone of genius.
- Mom's Alzheimer's is pretty bad, and at this point she usually doesn't remember if we even talked on the phone yesterday.
- My dog Rascal died from lymphoma late last year. This really was a shock to us and happened very quickly without much time to respond.
- We adopted Kahlua Dec 29, and she's much like Rascal a real asshole! But I love her, she's going to be great once we get her and Jasper operating well together.
- Walked 696.32 miles in 2025. While this isn't as far as I wanted, it is a massive improvement on basically any other year in my life. Daily dedicated time to walk at least some distance has never been a focus.

While we didn't do a ton of travel this year Taryn went with me for a work trip to Miami Beach, and we went to Pigeon Forge, TN for spring break with Jaelynn. We did however make many trips back to West TX to hang out with Jaelynn, and wrap up selling our house there.

All-in-all I'm pretty stoked to see what 2026 will bring. I'm still working on my focus and goals this year. I know most folks have all this worked out prior to January 1, but I've been head down on executing some other big goals in the last month of December and first bit of January such that I didn't get too caught up in the pomp and circumstance of building a goal list exactly on the first day.

For some cute pics!
