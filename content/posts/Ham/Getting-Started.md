The number one question I get from people that are new to radio is how to get started. My answer for 20 years has been to go to one of a handful of study sites (I'll link out to some good ones below), and start practicing for your amateur radio license. However, in the last several years I've realized that the vast majority of folks aren't wholly interested in the entire ham / amateur radio hobby.

What I mean is that like most things there is a certain amount of investment to enter a new field/hobby. Both in terms of time and money this investment can be great. However, not everyone wants to be consumed with RF/Electronics knowledge and activities. I have recently started steering folks to start with a GMRS license to test the waters and see if they are enjoying that sub-set of what the hobby has to offer.

## Reasons To Try GMRS
1. Any person can go purchase a license, with no exam, for $35. [FCC Site to Get a GMRS License](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/universal-licensing-system).
2. Starting with a MUCH more limited sub-set of frequencies, and hence less gear to consider.
   a. With Amateur Radio there is so much RF spectrum available, so many modes, so many ways to operate it can become daunting to get started. With GMRS its fairly simple, one set of channels (frequencies) on one band in one mode.
3. Use the radio and find folks that share the interest. 
   a. Most communities that have an active group of amateur radio operators probably have GMRS operators as well, and likely a shared set across both services as well.

## Gear To Start
Your main decision when getting started will be whether you want a handheld radio or a mobile radio. As most start with a handheld I'll focus on that. There are many options in the $50-$100 range and if your community has GMRS repeaters you'll be able to talk quite a distance depending on the repeater coverage.

Once you have decided that you in fact like the hobby, you can choose to buy a mobile radio and higher gain antenna for increased performance, and you can also start looking at the amateur radio license. Since your investment is lower, if you aren't enjoying it much you'll have an easy way to cut your losses. If you do decide to get an amateur radio license you'll have some idea on how the radios work, and how to use them. I'll add another post with recommendations of starting your radio adventure after an amateur radio license later, stay tuned...

## Diving Into Ham (FINALLY....)
I know you are likely here because you actually want the ham license and that is awesome! If you are at that point I recommend [Ham Study Online](https://hamstudy.org/) for US exams. I'm unfortunately not familiar with other licensing entities from other countries. A paid option, that is very good in my opinion is [HamTestOnline](https://www.hamradiolicenseexam.com/). I used this paid service when I upgraded to my General and Extra licenses. The method they use of testing and then explaining and repeating areas that you are getting incorrect is very good for learning the material.

If you are wanting other formats [Jason's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wwnOPaF1qI&pp=ygUcaGFtIHJhZGlvIGV4YW0gaGFtIHJhZGlvIDIuMA%3D%3D) are always great. He also has a version for [general upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOK_7wrtW0&list=PLs_Ab58w9LI9T0qCOsOD25KKTCAV92L5W), and [Extra class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krrU4iPLWWs&list=PLs_Ab58w9LI_6ENIq9q8geKXTrtHDT6ns). These are phenomonal resources.

The other major recommendation I have is to find a local group of hams or a ham club to meet and visit. Having elmers in this hobby is a very needed piece of your growth in the hobby.

You can always message me for help, as well!
