I haven't posted in quite some time, but I'm back and will be writing more regularly!

## Major Life Updates

### Work - IBM Acquisition
We've been acquired by IBM, which has brought tons of fun new learnings. It's been an exciting transition with new opportunities and challenges to dive into.

### New Home - Liberty Hill, TX
We're buying a house in Liberty Hill, TX (near Austin)! This is a big move for us and we're excited about the change of scenery and being closer to Austin.

## Ham Radio Activities

I've been pretty inactive with ham radio lately, but that's about to change. The new home is in an HOA, which will present some new challenges to figure out for antennas and operations. I'm hoping to work through those obstacles and get back on the air soon.

### POTA Success with KX3
One highlight from this summer was purchasing a KX3 and taking it on vacation where I was able to activate The Great Smoky Mountains National Park! It was an amazing experience and I'm excited to do more POTA activations in the future.

## Looking Forward

Overall, it's been a period of big changes and new adventures. I'm looking forward to sharing more updates through the blog as well as getting more active on the air soon. Stay tuned for more posts about the new QTH setup, HOA antenna solutions, and more POTA adventures!
